	<p style="color: white; font-size: 22px"> The Farm Fowl is a simple fast food restaurant. The seating area is very minimalistic and the kitchen is open. You are able to watch the staff prepare your food. All of the chicken, fries, and milkshakes are made to order. The chicken is cut into tenders and either served just as tenders or on a sandwich. There are different ‘heat levels’ for the tenders. If you ask for easy there is no additional seasoning. Mild seasoning is a in store made Nashville hot sauce, Medium seasoning is a sprinkle that adds a little spice, Hot is a step up, and finally Searing hot is the hottest seasoning on the menu. The milkshakes are slightly overpriced for the size but they taste good.

	<p style="color: white; font-size: 22px">Farm Fowl is located behind the Gus’s of Bartlett and the hotel. It is in the strip mall with Eat Well Buffet. It has been open since November of last year and took the old location of the Gus’s. Farm Fowl is also owned by the same person that owns the Sear Shack. The Sear Shack is like the burger version of the Farm Fowl.
